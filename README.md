# tictactoe

This project is a game of Tic Tac Toe that you can play in your browser.  
  
As part of The Odin Project intermediate JavaScript course, my aim with this project is to demonstrate a good understanding of things I have recently learned such as creating objects with factory functions, using module patterns and making use of closures with private and public variables/functions.
